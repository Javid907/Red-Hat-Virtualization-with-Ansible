# Red Hat Virtualization Ansible
Install Red Hat Virtualization from Ansible

I am a beginnerÂ in Ansible. I wanted for my first project in git to be related to Ansible and I thought, that Ansible for RHV is good for people which want to use Red Hat Virtualization in their IT infrastructure.

Please don't blame me for errors.

Like ipasever I used freeipa-ansible from  https://github.com/freeipa
